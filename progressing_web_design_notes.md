Progressing Web Design:

Hello everyone. Thanks for having me I'm excited to be here. Let me first tell you a little about myself. I'm a graduate of RIT, a tech college located up in Rochester NY. There I studied design as well as development along side science technology and society. My passions really lie in building simple systems that solve complex problems. I like to imagine these issues nested within human computer interaction. So I'm not really a UI Designer, or a UX Designer, or a Front-end Web developer. I incorporate all of these aspects into my work beceause I love working with the system as a whole. I'm also somewhat of an entrepreneur. I co-founded an ed-tech startup during my Sophomore year of college and took that through two business accelerators.

Because of the abbreviated nature of these lightning talks I'm going to be discussing two general concepts that I've been using lately as I design and prototype websites and apps. These concepts are part of a system I like to call Progressing Web Design and that's why I've titled the talk as such.

- The first concept I want to discuss is called "Atomic Design". A process which has been popularized by web designer Brad Frost. I'm sure some of you have read his blog.

- Atomic design is really about breaking the elements we use in web design down into their base components. A process of modularizing the design process if you will. Now this can be applied to several design disciplines. I'm applying it to web design because I feel that it works the best in this environment.

- Just as in nature we want to start with the smallest components; atoms. The HTML tags we use to structure our design. Alone, these really do nothing, but they are the essential building blocks of our product.

- Atoms are then joined together by molecules. The more meaningful connections between our atoms. The clearest example of this method is an HTML form tag. This makes use of our individualized elements and combines them to create something useful. From here we can start brining in other atoms to form even more complex molecules which in turn help us buildâ€¦. 

- Organisms. These can be described as larger "sections" of our site. A clear example of this method is a website header; combining an unordered list, a logo, and the login form from before. As you can see each next step is a process of combination; just the same as it is in nature. It should also be noted that this is perhaps the beginning of our UI. Before we had assets and individualized elements that certainly need visual attention by themselves but it's at this point in our process where the forms and shapes really start to come to fruition. This might be the time to start talking with your client, if you don't have a client conisder yourself lucky, so you can start showing them how the site or app might be designed.

- Once we get our organisms designed we go into gluing them together. This is the process of building templates. By this time we've got a language or framework together and we've begun to re-factor our prototypes to be implemented into those systems. Brad Frost calls this step "layout" in action and I really can't think of a better way of describing it than that.

- The last step in the Atomic Design Process happens when we begin to implement real content. Buttons preform functions and submit data, stock photography is replaced with actual images, colors and typography are tweaked to represent the final product.

- Atomic Desgign gives us as designers a unique oportunity to scale a product from something small and somewhat useless on its own, to something functioning and complete.

- Another system I've incorporated into my work lately is really the combination of a few resources. I'm calling it modular sass for the sake of this discussion but it draws on the methods taught by Jonathan Snook in his book SMACSS.

- So what is it? It's built on SASS, a CSS preprocessor that makes working with the syntax much easier. In short SASS allows one to apply logic to styles to get them to act a little smarter. A good example is by providing a method called @extend for having DRY (don't repeat yourself) code. This allows you to apply similar base styles to various elements while only wrinting that base chunk of code once. I encourage you to explore SASS more it's amazing.

- Here's how I use it. I start with styling my smallest components first. Those atoms that we talked about in the Atmoic desgin process.
